    <h1>Experience:</h1>
    <div>
      <h2>I previously worked as a nurse for 3 years, I worked in:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Acute medicine which is part of the emergency department</li>
      <li>Haemodialysis which is nurse directed</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I was looking for a career change and discovered this role.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>My Transferable Skills:</h2>
    <p>You may be thinking- what skills would I have from nursing that I can apply here?</p>

    <p>Below are some examples:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><strong>Problem-Solving</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nursing:</strong> Nurses constantly troubleshoot and make decisions to resolve health problems under 
              pressure. This includes: assessing patients symptoms, analyse test results, and implement treatment plans.</li>
              <li><strong>Developers:</strong> Developers also need strong problem-solving skills to debug, implement designs and troubleshoot problems. 
                Developers break down complex problems into smaller, manageable tasks, similarily to diagnosing and treating patient deterioration.
              </li>
          </ul>
        <li><strong>Adaptability</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nursing:</strong> Healthcare environments are fast-paced and constantly changing. Nurses must quickly adapt to new situations, technologies, and protocols.</li>
            <li><strong>Developers:</strong> Technology evolves rapidly, requiring developers to continually learn new programming languages, frameworks, and methodologies. 
              Adaptability ensures developers can keep up with industry changes.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><strong>Communication Skills</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nursing:</strong> Nurses are used to communicating with patients, families, and 
              healthcare teams. They explain complex medical conditions and instructions in a clear, understandable way.</li>
            <li><strong>Developers:</strong> Developers often collaborate with teams, stakeholders, and clients, explaining 
              technical concepts to non-technical audiences and working together to build solutions. Effective 
              written and verbal communication is key.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><strong>Time Management and Prioritisation</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nursing:</strong> Managing a busy workload, prioritising patient care, and handling emergencies 
              all require excellent time management and prioritisation. </li>
            <li><strong>Developers:</strong> Developers often work on multiple projects with deadlines. Balancing competing priorities, 
              managing sprints, and meeting project milestones are essential for staying productive and efficient.</li>
          </ul>
        <li><strong>Attention to Detail</strong></li>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Nursing:</strong> Accuracy is critical in 
              nursing, whether it's administering medication or documenting patient information. 
              Small mistakes can have significant consequences.</li>
            <li><strong>Developers:</strong> In coding, even a small error can cause bugs or system crashes. 
              Writing clean, efficient, and error-free code requires the same high level of precision and 
              attention to detail as in healthcare.</li>
          </ul>
      </ol>
